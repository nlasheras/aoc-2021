## Log

### Day 1

I've done two straight-forward implementations in Python. For **part 2** I improved the straightforward version caching previous value to avoid doing the sums twice. 

### Day 2 

First version of today's problem. Since it's only 3 commands to handle I didn't bother of implementing a better "switch". 

### Day 3 

First version using strings. My solution can be changed to operate with bits but since it ran pretty fast anyways didn't feel the need for it. For **part 1** I relied on just flipping the bits to get gamma, but for **part 2** I added a parameter to use the same logic with both versions. I'd like to clean it a bit later, since I got a bit stuck an off-by-one edge cases.
